Both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries are available, but the 64-bit ones (that is, aarch64 and x86_64) are considered EXPERIMENTAL (in big scary letters).  Also, there are different options for MIDI playback support that use different libraries, so there may or may not be limits on what ones you're willing to support, I suppose?\r\n\r\nAll the supported games so far appear to be the RPG/strategic \"point-and-click\" titles of the 90s - whether these would be mostly playable on many of the PM-supported devices I wouldn't know, but I have a hunch that analog sticks at the very least will be recommended.\r\n\r\nI figured a single page for this project would be sufficient enough rather than create a page for each supported game and link to the same Github page for all of them.

This was likely due to issues with font loading or rendering.\r\nCurrent Status:\r\n\r\nThe game now starts without crashing.\r\nThe main menu appears to be functional (you can click \"New Game\").\r\nHowever, you cannot interact with the chess pieces to move them.\r\n\r\nRoot Cause (Suspected):\r\nThe font loading issue seems to have been resolved by correctly defining the FONTS_DIR and ensuring the font was loaded properly. This fixed the immediate crash.\r\nCurrent Issue:\r\nThe inability to move pieces suggests there might be a problem with:\r\n\r\nEvent handling for mouse interactions with the game board\r\nGame state management after starting a new game\r\nPossible threading issues related to AI player thinking or game logic\r\n\r\nNext Steps:\r\n\r\nAnalyze the debug output from the event handling system to see if mouse events are being properly recognized on the game board.\r\nVerify that the game state is correctly initialized after starting a new game.\r\nCheck if there are any issues with the AI thinking thread that might be blocking user input.\r\nAttachment file type: archive\r\nbrutalchess.zip\r\n20.28 MB\r\nI'm done with it, 5 hours and no longer motivated to do further stuff\r\nAt least the main menu works now\r\nand you can let the cpus play against each other\r\n\r\nSlayer366: Ported NiceChess in favor of Brutal Chess as it was based off of Brutal Chess 0.5.2 with quality-of-life improvements and converted to SDL2.

While looking identical to the original, it does make some subtle changes to the overall experience.  Inexplicably, nobody seems to have made a full list of the actual changes, so I can only report on the ones I've seen myself, namely:\r\n\r\n- When standing in front of a dungeon door, a popup box conveniently showing the name of the dungeon in question appears.  This is useful for knowing which doors go with which keys.\r\n- The BGM will now resume from where it left off after finishing playing a jingle, instead of starting over from the beginning.\r\n- Collision detection seems to have been tweaked here and there.  For instance, whereas in OG HCL you could comfortably whack a wall cannon above you with your sword without having to physically jump to it, you can't in this one.\r\n\r\nThat's all I remember so far.

What's more is this could be possible via Polymost or Polymer (OpenGL modes for Eduke based source ports) if it's implemented with GLES, but even EDuke32 suffers from not having GLES support for these modes and the one or two custom builds that do only seem to work on a Raspberry Pi.","content":"Commercial","date":"2024-07-01","dependencies":"Other/Unknown","engine":"Other/Unknown","feasibility":"Low","id":"abaed3c4637f42f2a2716decd09bc926","imageurl":"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dukenukem/images/1/1f/DN64_Box.jpg/revision/latest/smart/width/386/height/259?cb=20100813161132","language":"C/C++","license":"Other/Unknown","status":"Rejected","tags":"","title":"Duke Nukem 64 (Rednukem)","userid":"d064630eeb554ef785bf3d81f1277143","voteCount":4,"weburl":"https://github.com/nukeykt/NBlood"},{"author":"","category":"Game","comment":"This is a RPG Maker 2003 game can be played with easyrpg","content":"Free","date":"2024-07-01","dependencies":"","engine":"RPGMaker","feasibility":"Low","id":"36bcb53b7f414e1fb50d81d5fcc7525c","imageurl":"https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvNjQxMzEwLzM0MzMxNzkucG5n/original/WgNRE%2F.png","language":"Other/Unknown","license":"Other/Unknown","status":"Rejected","tags":"","title":"Exile's Journey","userid":"669adcfa45114179a136176051fbe325","voteCount":0,"weburl":"https://moonphaseproductions.itch.io/exiles-journey"},{"author":"","category":"Game","comment":"","content":"Open Source","date":"2024-07-01","dependencies":"","engine":"Other/Unknown","feasibility":"Medium","id":"7689475f20ad4adc9fa3bad40c4bd96e","imageurl":"https://www.shadowofthewyrm.org/img/sotw1.webp","language":"Lua","license":"CC-BY-*","status":"Open","tags":"","title":"Shadow Of The Wyrm","userid":"feab922af0b74465b1812d59eb001ab6","voteCount":8,"weburl":"https://www.shadowofthewyrm.org/"},{"author":"","category":"Game","comment":"Made on O.H.R.RPG.C.E.

Has a variety of older demos available (latest being the Eggplant Build in 2022, closest demo to release build and features a lot of things shown in the final release)\r\n\r\nUses Bytecode and GMS 2022.9.0.0\r\n\r\nGame can be intensive on low end hardware; can likely boost performance by disabling certain unneeded elements (e.g. level backgrounds)\r\n\r\nThere are unofficial Android APKs that exist and are functional as the full game, though they tend to be multiple versions behind.\r\n\r\nOfficially, the game is Windows-only. Runs on Linux through Proton. \r\n\r\nLooking at internal assets, it uses shaders that utilise GLSL_ES.

It is a homebrew platformer made in the spirit of Capcom\u2019s classic Megaman (Rockman in Japan) game series (1-6 and 9-10), that have original storyline and graphics, besides an editor where the user can edit their own stage and enemies. \r\n\r\nThis has been around for quite a long time now.  It's seen many console and handheld ports in various years and state of completion/production for the likes of PSP, PS2, Wii, NDS, (Open)Dingux, OpenPandora, Raspberry Pi, and PocketGo (on top of the standard Windows and Linux versions).\r\n\r\nOriginally, it resembled Megaman more closely in terms of certain art, animations, startup sequences and overall style.  But in 2019 there was apparently a kerfuffle with Google over the Android port that had been released to Google Play, where other people accused it of copying Megaman too much (even though the developer stressed on his blog that very few elements of the game were borrowed from Megaman at the time) - note that there's nothing to suggest that Capcom themselves ever so much as said a word about the project, let alone complain about it.  So it got pulled from the app store, and the developer decided (in order to get it back on there and rechristen it \"RockDroid\") to significantly change much of the game to make it less \"Megaman-like\", mainly in the artwork (which adopted a new 'chibi' style), sprites and startup animations (the music meanwhile was always \"original\", or at least borrowed from Modland et al).  The old versions of the project are still available for download so you can see how much the game got changed over the years for yourself.  (The chosen screenshot - according to the URL, is from v1.1.0 back in 2015.

It appears the source code for Unreal 1 had been available for some years now judging by the existence of this GitHub page: https://github.com/RedPandaProjects/UnrealEngine\r\n\r\nWell, fast forward to today and a visit to VitaDB revealed a PS Vita port.  Which led me to the GitHub page for UE1 as linked.  The port exists for Windows, Linux and Vita, and the Linux version currently supports both X86 and ARM32.  Nothing about a 64-bit version so far, but it's probably early days.  So most handhelds should be able to (hopefully) support this, but it looks like the TeaSpooners are screwed. :\\\r\n\r\nCurrently supported are v200 of the original retail game (which after some testing can confirm to be literally any non-OEM version of the OG U1 from '98) and the v205 demo (also known as Unreal Special Edition).  *Not* currently supported are any OEM edition of U1, any version of Return to Na Pali, and Unreal Gold.  Given that the Unreal series was removed from all digital storefronts yet Epic recently gave OldUnreal.com their blessing to make installers for U1 and UT99 that download the original ISO images from Archive.org and extract the data, apply the newest community patches et al, *and* have started acknowledging this on their own website (https://www.epicgames.com/unrealtournament) this seems like jolly good timing. :)  Question: can the content still be considered \"Commercial\" when it's no longer being sold anywhere and the company themselves is like \"sure, go ahead and use free ISOs for your installers\"?\r\n\r\nNote: I wasn't too sure whether to select \"Unreal\" for the Engine part.  I mean, it's literally Unreal, but I assume that option is mainly intended for modern-day UE like 4 or 5 or whatever the commonly used version is.  So I just picked \"Other/Unknown\" until somebody can clarify things. :)","content":"Commercial","date":"2025-01-13","dependencies":"OpenGL,SDL 2.x","engine":"Other/Unknown","feasibility":"Medium","id":"927a7cf4df954197af8750e90c289b7d","imageurl":"https://hardforum.com/data/attachment-files/2023/01/795312_Unreal.jpg","language":"C/C++","license":"Other/Unknown","status":"Open","tags":"","title":"UE1","userid":"388d7a60f2be43899ba19768fd2fae4c","voteCount":12,"weburl":"https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/UE1"},{"author":"","category":"Game","comment":"Since the game is open source, a native port might be possible: https://github.com/Interrupt/delverengine\r\n\r\nIf not, it does have a native Linux port.\r\n\r\nIdeally, however, a native port would possibly work better since it could be tailored to the limitations of many Portmaster-supported devices.\r\n\r\n","content":"Commercial","date":"2025-03-10","dependencies":"JVM,libGDX","engine":"Other/Unknown","feasibility":"Low","id":"2a17a60278f64adaabf13f88102ff94c","imageurl":"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/249630/ss_7d8ad2ce66996312d889b2273d6e20a5595c1d76.jpg","language":"Java","license":"MIT/BSD/zlib","status":"Open","tags":"","title":"Delver","userid":"8e85dc1f5f6d418ca63c3ef87f2a53d3","voteCount":49,"weburl":"http://delvergame.com/"},{"author":"","category":"Game","comment":"Recently got updated to using FNA framework.
