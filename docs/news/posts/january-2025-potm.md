## About Bar Hop

Bar Hop is a rhythm game inspired by the arcade classic Frogger where you:

* **Hop your way to the bar and back**, dodging traffic and hazards!
* **Avoid falling in the river** as the challenge ramps up across 7 days in a row!
* **Score points** for every successful hop, reaching the bar, returning home, and collecting coins along the way!

It's all about timing, rhythm, and split-second decisions—perfect for a fresh start to the year!

## Port of the Month Rules

As always, you can either **participate** or **compete**!

### To Participate
