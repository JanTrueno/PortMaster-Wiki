# :tada: 1,000 PORTS :tada:
We’ve just hit a major milestone — over 1,000 ports are now available through PortMaster!
We want to take a moment to thank everyone who helped us get here.

<!-- more -->

Whether you’ve been testing builds, sharing feedback, porting games, or simply enjoying what the community has created — you’ve been part of something special.

A huge thank you to all our Crew , Port Engineers , and Port Cadets . You’re the backbone of this project. Your creativity, patience, and persistence have brought so many games to life on new hardware.

This isn’t just a celebration of what we’ve done — it’s a reminder of what’s still ahead. Big things are coming, and we’re already looking toward the next 1,000.

**Thanks for being here with us.**

We’ve put together a video to mark the moment — check it out everyone!
