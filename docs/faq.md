## Our Stance on Piracy

??? question "What is your stance on Piracy"
    At PortMaster, we believe in supporting game developers and publishers by ensuring that all game ports are created and used with legitimately purchased software.
    
    **How PortMaster Works:**
    
    Our platform enables you to install ports from games you've bought on trusted platforms like Steam, GOG, Epic Games Store, and Itch.io. This approach ensures that developers receive the compensation they deserve, encouraging further innovation and quality in the gaming industry.
    
    **Ready to Run Ports:**
    
    Some ports in PortMaster are "Ready to Run" - these include:
    
    - Open-source games that are freely distributable
    - Games where developers have personally given us permission to distribute
    - Freeware titles with proper licensing
    
    These ports install completely and require no additional files.
    
    **Commercial Ports:**
    
    All other ports require you to provide your own legally obtained game files from legitimate purchases.
    
    **What We Require:**
    
    - All ports require legally obtained game files (unless Ready to Run)
    - Purchase games from legitimate sources
    - Respect developer intellectual property
    
    **What We Don't Support:**
    
    - Unlicensed or pirated game files
    - Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted content  
    - Pre-packaged ports that include commercial game files without permission
    - Any activity that violates intellectual property rights
    
    **Zero Tolerance:** PortMaster has zero tolerance for piracy. We are free and open-source software, but we never distribute copyrighted game files or enable piracy.
