No additional files needed.</p> <p>Commercial Ports: Ports that require you to own the game. You must provide your own legally purchased game files.</p> How do I install a port? <p>See our Installing Ports guide for complete instructions.</p> Where do I get game files for commercial ports? <p>You must purchase games from legitimate sources like Steam, GOG, Epic Games Store, or Itch.io. After installing a port from PortMaster, visit the Games page, find your game, and click Details for file placement instructions.</p> Can I install ports without WiFi? <p>Yes! Download the port's <code>.zip</code> file on a computer and place it in the autoinstall folder.

They include game engines, frameworks, and dependencies. PortMaster installs these automatically when needed, or you can pre-install them for offline use. See the Runtimes Guide.</p> Can I use PortMaster on stock firmware? <p>PortMaster is designed for custom firmware (CFW) like ROCKNIX, ArkOS, muOS, and KNULLI. Stock firmware is generally not supported.</p> How much storage do I need? <p>This varies by port. Most ports are under 500MB, but some larger games can be several gigabytes. Check individual port details before installing.</p> Can I delete ports I don't want? <p>Yes!

GameMaker uses rooms as a space to load content, and will often contain preplaced static content such as tiles to avoid draw calls later. A game can have several different rooms, like one for the title screen, and then another for the game itself, etc. These rooms are loaded into memory wholesale, so if a room has massive dimensions (think 10,000 x 20,000), it might also have a massive amount of object instances. This means the entire game will chug while using that room. A good example of this is UFO 50\u2019s Ninpek game. If we open UFO 50 in UndertaleModTool and load rm34_Ninpek, we can instantly see why it\u2019s choppy and slow on small-arm handhelds: the room dimensions are 15,360 x 216. Ninpek is a sidescrolling game with a constantly moving camera, so it\u2019s natural for the developer to create a room like this to hold the content and flow. However, because the room contains so many instances, it slows to a crawl on low-power devices. There\u2019s not much we can do about a room like this, though, at least not without heavily tampering with the game\u2014which would essentially deviate the project from a simple compatibility patch and turn it into a complete mod.</p> <p>Isle of Sea and Sky</p> <p>Isles of Sea and Sky is another fine example of performance troubleshooting. In IOSAS, entering specific areas will result in a huge framerate drop\u2014which instantly recovers as soon as the area is left. This again indicates a problem with rooms. IOSAS has a specific set of rooms called \u201cgod rooms\u201d that load a specific script that has to do with \u201cgod gem\u201d special effects. This special effect in question is a calculation loop for drawing lines to synchronize with gems rotating around a sprite. Calculations are already CPU-intensive tasks, so putting them into a loop that executes every frame is asking for low performance. This particular case was resolved by modifying the loop to retrieve variables from a file pm-config.ini, an ini file specially made for the port. Inside, the user can configure two variables: Idol_SFX and FrameSkip. If Idol_SFX=1, meaning the loop is allowed to execute, then FrameSkip=x will dictate when the loop will execute. Instead of executing every frame (FrameSkip=0), we can modify the value so the loop only executes every 20 or 30 frames. This results in a change: our low framerate is now a stutter, where the game \u201cpauses\u201d once every x frames when it performs the calculation step. This means the special effect also isn\u2019t perfectly aligned\u2014but it preserves the artistic effect somewhat while compensating for low CPU power.</p>"},{"location":"contribute/porting/engines/gamemaker-studio/#compiling","title":"Compiling","text":"<p>Gmloader-next can be cross-compiled using the following steps. </p> <p>Info</p> <p>This is for development and contribution only, prebuilds are available in the example packages.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Clone the repository and all submodules </p><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/JohnnyonFlame/gmloader-next --recursive\n</code></pre><p></p> </li> <li> <p>Build the project with desired target platform options </p><pre><code>make -f Makefile.gmloader ARCH=aarch64-linux-gnu\n</code></pre><p></p> </li> <li> <p>Example: Build using Debian Bullseye for older platforms </p><pre><code>make -f Makefile.gmloader \\\nARCH=aarch64-linux-gnu \\\nLLVM_FILE=/usr/lib/llvm-11/lib/libclang-11.so.1 \\\nLLVM_INC=/usr/aarch64-linux-gnu/include/c++/10/aarch64-linux-gnu \\\n-j$(nproc)\n</code></pre><p></p> </li> <li> <p>Generate the libc dependencies </p><pre><code>python3 scripts/generate_libc.py aarch64-linux-gnu \\\n--llvm-includes /usr/aarch64-linux-gnu/include/c++/10/aarch64-linux-gnu \\\n--llvm-library-file \"/usr/lib/llvm-11/lib/libclang-11.so.1\"\n</code></pre><p></p> </li> <li> <p>Deploy: Copy the lib redist folder to the application directory] </p><pre><code>cp -r lib_redist/ &lt;application_folder&gt;/\n</code></pre><p></p> </li> </ul> <p>For more details, check the full documentation.</p>"},{"location":"contribute/porting/engines/gamemaker-studio/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>By leveraging the tools and knowledge outlined in this guide, PortMaster Engineers enable modern GameMaker Studio games to run smoothly on small ARM-based handheld devices.
